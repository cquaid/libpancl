1. Should the built-in "integer" type be implementation-specific instead of
   forced to be a 32-bit value?  It's a bit annoying using int_least32_t for
   this as the common use-case would be "int".

2. Should a date/timestamp type be added as a first-class type or as an
   optional ::Date("...")?

3. Implement ::Float("...").

4. Write a parser for floating point numbers
